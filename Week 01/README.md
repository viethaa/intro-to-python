    <h1>Setup & Installation</h1>
</div>

 `*` *Before we start coding, it is important to setup and install the right applications:*

+ `Visual Studio Code 🔧`; a lightweight and powerful code editor with built-in support for Python, making coding, debugging, and development easier.

+ `Python 🧩`; the core language for this project, needed to run scripts, manage dependencies, and use essential libraries.

<br>

## ```Task 01:```  🔧

`*` Download [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

When download is finished:
- Make a new folder on your desktop and name it `Intro to Python`
- Select, and open the folder on Visual Code Studio
- Refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMxo3T_MTvY) if needed

<br>

## ```Task 02:```  🧩

`*` Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3132/)

Make sure:
- You downloaded latest version `3.13.2`
- You downloaded the correct file for your computer type
- Refer to this [video](https://youtu.be/YKSpANU8jPE?si=y-j3VbxNSl3QlIxv) if needed

<br>

## ```Task 03:``` 💻

`*` Write your first Python code!

To start:
- Go to Visual Studio Code, and make a new file
- Name it: `hello.py`

<br>

Type in the following:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

<br>

## ```Run Python Code: ▶️```

1. **Open VS Code**  
   - Start Visual Studio Code on your computer.

<br>

2. **Open the Terminal**  
   - Press **`Ctrl/Command` + `J`** (the little backtick key, usually under the Esc key).  
   - A panel will open at the bottom of VS Code — this is the terminal.

<br>

3. **Run Your Python File**  
   - In the terminal, type:

```python
python3 your_file_name.py
```

<br>
