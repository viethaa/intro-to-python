    <h1>Variables & If Else Statements</h1>
</div>

`*` *Variables and If Else statements are fundamental building blocks in Python Code*

- `Variables 🪣` store data, while `if-else statements ⚖️` help make decisions based on conditions.
- Understanding these concepts will allow you programs in Python.

## ```Variables 🪣```

`*` Variables are used to store data in Python. They act as containers for values that can be changed throughout the program.

- Variable names must start with a `letter` or an `underscore _`
- Variable names cannot start with a number
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different)

<br>

Example:
```python
name = "Kanye"   # name is the variable, "Kanye" is the str value
age = "17"       # age is the variable, 17 is the int value
```
